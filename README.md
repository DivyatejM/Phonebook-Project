## Phonebook Project
<br>
We have all come across the Linked List Data Structure. <br>
I have created a Phonebook project using C++. <br><br>
It uses the the Object Oriented Programming Concepts and Classes and Objects like Friend Function, Friend Class, Access specifiers, etc.
<br><br>
1. User Defined Data Structure using Class to store the details.<br>
    i. Name<br>
   ii. Contact Number<br>
  iii. Email Address<br><br>
2. Previous and Next Pointers to store the addresses of previous and next person in phonebook.<br><br>
3. Created a Utility Class that is declared as a Friend Class that contains all the utility functions to perform operations.<br><br>
4. Menu Driven Program that allows user to<br>
   i. Display the Contact Details in the Phonebook.<br>
  ii. Insert New Contact.<br>
 iii. Update Details.<br>
  iv. Delete Contacts.<br>
   v. Search<br><br>

Brief:<br>
I have created a node class to store the data and used an utility class to perform all the operations.<br>
This utility class has been decalred as a friend class to the node class. <br>
I have used Doubly Linked List to store maintain the connections with the previous and next Contact in the Phonebook.
